# Universal Guidelines

## Code Quality Standards
- **Confidence Threshold**: Add code only when 95% confident in its correctness and alignment with project requirements
- **Comments**: Avoid adding comments unless they are essential for understanding complex business logic, algorithms, or non-obvious decisions
- **Code Philosophy**: Write enterprise-grade, simple, maintainable, readable, modular, and scalable code
- **DRY Principle**: Don't Repeat Yourself - extract common logic into reusable utilities or components
- **Single Responsibility**: Each function, component, or module should have a single, well-defined purpose

## File Organization
- **React Components**: 
  - Filename: `camelCase.tsx` (e.g., `userProfile.tsx`, `dataTable.tsx`)
  - Folder name: `kebab-case` (e.g., `user-profile/`, `data-table/`)
- **Utilities**: Use `kebab-case` for utility files (e.g., `format-date.ts`, `validate-schema.ts`)
- **Constants**: Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for exported constants

## Error Handling
- Always handle errors explicitly - never silently fail
- Use proper error types and meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging without exposing sensitive information

## Performance
- Optimize for Edge-first execution (low latency, minimal dependencies)
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders and computations
- Use appropriate caching strategies

## Security
- Never commit API keys, secrets, or sensitive data
- Validate all user inputs and external data
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow principle of least privilege
